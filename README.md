# MonsterGame
Programming Methods II Midterm Project
This is a text based Monster Game.

This game was created with Java.
In this project we had to implement everything we learned in our programming methods II class.
That includes applying a Scanner, for the player to make choices.
Applied what I learned about inheritance by using extends in order to create the Monsters and their rooms.

In order to try this out:
1. Download the java files

2. Open the files and Run :)
